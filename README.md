<b>Part 1: Gutenberg Richter Law</b>
<p align="justify">The Gutenberg and Richter relationship describes a region's seismicity and tectonic patterns through frequency and magnitude relationship (MFR) analysis. This analysis uses the Gutenberg and Richter equation (Gutenberg & Richter, 1944).</p>
𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑁(𝑀) = 𝑎 − 𝑏M .......................................... (1) <br><br>

<p align="justify">In equation 1, N(M) is the cumulative number of earthquakes, where M is the magnitude used in the research, and the values a and b are the seismicity constant and stress distribution constant, respectively. The b-value shows the gradient of the linear equation of frequency and magnitude relationship. The magnitude value that can explain Equation 1 well is between 4.5 and 7.0 because a magnitude value greater than 7.0 means linearity deviation is possible (Madlazim, 2013).</p>

<b>Part 2: Temporal Analysis using a and b value</b><br>
<b>Part 3: Spatial Analysis using a and b value</b><br>

Spatial and temporal variations of a-values and b-values in earthquakes in several study areas

<p align="justify">Seismicity parameters or what is usually called <b>a-values</b> is a seismic parameter whose value depends on the number of earthquake events, volume, and time window which is within the research limits (Rohadi, et al., 2007).Seismicity values can indicate data characteristics the level of seismicity of an area </p>

<p align="justify">Tectonic parameters or <b>b-values</b> can reflect. Local stress accumulation can thus be a parameter Seismicity is obtained from the relative frequency of quantities the occurrence of large and small earthquakes in an area. The b-value is used to determine changes in phenomena
physics observed before an earthquake occurs. The physical phenomenon that can be observed is the accumulation stress that will then be released when an earthquake occurs earth. The b-value correlates with the stress distribution
and strain so that it can be used as an indicator of stress in a region (Ghassabian et al, 2016)</p>
